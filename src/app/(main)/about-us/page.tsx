          HerSynergy Tribe: Bridging Gaps, Building Connections
        </h1>

        <p className="text-14 lg:text-20 font-georgia max-w-[1120px] mx-auto">
          Women make up only 28% of C-suite positions, with even fewer Black
          women represented. The path to senior leadership can feel isolating,
          with limited mentorship, fewer opportunities, and the constant
          challenge of negotiating for equitable pay.¬† <br />
          <br />
          HerSynergy Tribe was founded in September 2023 to address these
          challenges by creating a supportive community where women can access
          mentorship, resources, and genuine connections to propel their careers
          forward.
